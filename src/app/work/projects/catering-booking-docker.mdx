## Docker Architecture

**Container Services:**
- **PHP/Apache Container**: Main application server with PHP 8.x and Apache
- **MySQL Container**: Database service with persistent volume mounting
- **phpMyAdmin Container**: Web-based database administration interface

**Key Docker Features:**
- **Volume Persistence**: Data survives container restarts and rebuilds
- **Environment Isolation**: Clean separation between development and production configs  
- **Port Mapping**: Accessible web interface and database connections
- **Network Configuration**: Internal container communication and external access

---

## My Role & Technical Contributions

As the sole developer, I architected and implemented:

- **Containerization Strategy**: Designed the complete Docker Compose configuration for multi-service deployment
- **Database Architecture**: Created the MySQL schema and automated seeding process via `cateringdata.sql`
- **Authentication System**: Built secure user authentication with PHP sessions and password hashing
- **API Integration**: Implemented payment gateway API with secure configuration handling
- **Development Workflow**: Established live reload and persistent data systems for team collaboration
- **Environment Management**: Created environment-based configuration separation for secure deployment

---

## Technical Highlights

- **Zero-Dependency Setup**: Eliminated XAMPP requirements, enabling any team member to spin up the environment with a single `docker-compose up` command
- **Security Best Practices**: Used environment variables for sensitive configuration data, preventing hardcoded credentials in source code
- **Database Automation**: Implemented automatic database initialization and sample data loading for immediate testing capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Docker ensures consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux development environments
- **Scalable Architecture**: Container-based design allows easy horizontal scaling and service isolation

---

## Development & Deployment Benefits

- **Team Collaboration**: Instant development environment setup for new team members
- **Environment Consistency**: Identical development, staging, and production environments
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lightweight containers with optimized resource allocation
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure as Code approach with all configurations in Git
- **Easy Maintenance**: Simplified updates and dependency management through Docker images

## Impact & Learning Outcomes

This project significantly enhanced my **DevOps skills** and demonstrated the power of containerization in modern web development. It eliminated the common "works on my machine" problem and established a professional development workflow that scales with team size.

The experience gained in **Docker containerization**, **environment management**, and **API integration** has become fundamental to my approach to building maintainable, scalable web applications.
