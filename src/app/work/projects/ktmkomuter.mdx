## Introduction
This project is an online ticketing system for KTM Komuter developed using ASP.NET MVC with C#. It allows passengers to purchase tickets from any selected station to another, covering all routes provided in the fare table. The system offers one-way or return tickets and provides discounts for senior citizens (30%), disabled (35%), and students (25%).

## Features
- Purchase tickets for any route (one-way or return)
- Discounts for senior citizens, disabled, and students
- Input validation for accurate data entry
- Email notifications with transaction details
- All transactions stored in SQL Server database
- Management reports with filtering and sorting (LINQ)
- User interface with Bootstrap and ASP.NET MVC layout
- Additional features for customers and management
