## Overview

**Raska** is a social impact mobile application developed during the **UMPSA Hackathon**, designed to tackle food insecurity through innovative technology solutions. Built with **Flutter**, this app creates a bridge between food donors and individuals facing hunger, promoting community-driven food sharing and reducing food waste.

The application addresses the critical issue of food insecurity by leveraging technology to create an efficient, user-friendly platform that connects resources with needs in real-time.

---

## Problem Statement

Food insecurity affects millions globally, while simultaneously, tons of edible food are wasted daily. Traditional food distribution methods often lack efficiency, real-time coordination, and community engagement. Raska was conceptualized to bridge this gap through technology-driven solutions.
